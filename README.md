# VHDL_and_VHDL_AMS_dump

This project is simply a dump for my VHDL and VHDL AMS projects. Largely contians basic digial components as well as computer components for a simple RISC V 32I processor

Contains 2 PDFs for pipelined MIPS and RISC V processors made in the Mentor Graphics Xpedition AMS software.

DISCLAIMER - The FPU files listed were not designed by me. A few of the more simple VHDL files may also be modified from the stock Mentor Graphics VHDL files included in their SVlib. All other files that are titled with my name were designed by me.
